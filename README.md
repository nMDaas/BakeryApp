# BakeryApp

## Introduction
For our project, we created a baking app for bakers and everyday people to use to discover new recipes they can bake. As people who enjoy baking themselves, we found it difficult to find good recipes to follow so we wanted to provide a database of recipes where users can upload their own recipes or view other user’s recipes that they’ve written. Local bakeries or bakery companies can also use the database to upload official recipes for users to enjoy. Our app will keep track of the users inventory or amounts of ingredients they have and double check for them if it’s possible to bake a recipe they find for convenience. Users also can select dessert types that they enjoy such as cakes or pastries, and new recipes will be recommended to them based on their preferences, and if they enjoy the recipe, they can save it to look at it again later on. 

## Technical Details
For our project submission, we wrote our Java code using Eclipse software, our SQL code using MySQL, and connected them using the JDBC connector for Java 8.0.28. These codes are the only things needed to run the application. Output for the application and user interaction occurs in the java console. If the software you’re using to run our java code doesn’t have a console, the link for eclipse is provided here: https://eclipseide.org/release/

## How to Run 
To run our database, download the SQL file and make sure all tables, values, procedures, functions, and triggers are inserted or created into the bakeryapp database. Next, download the Java bakingapp file and load it into eclipse or your preferred platform for running java code. Next, run the java program. It should automatically prompt the user in the console after you have hit the run button.
